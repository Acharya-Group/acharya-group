        “Yoga is a light, which once lit, will never dim. The better your
        practice, the brighter the flame.” The term "Yoga" in the Western world
        often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise,
        consisting largely of the postures called asanas. Yoga, the mental,
        physical and spiritual practice to positively transform one’s body and
        mind, which originated in India about 5000 years ago has received its
        deserved accreditation by the United Nations by way of International
        Yoga Day to be celebrated worldwide every year on June 21. Hon’ble Prime
        Minister of India Shri.Narendra Modi has taken a leadership to spread
        this India’s cultural and spiritual heritage worldwide with credible
        system which shall provide India leadership to ensure the quality in
        teaching and training in Yoga.

        Yoga is essentially spiritual. It dignifies the essential unity that is
        the basis of life. It embraces the full spectrum of reality, from the
        most spiritual to the most material. The Philosophy of Yoga is practical
        and applicable in our day-to-day living. The practice of Yoga is a
        process of self-discovery. It is an awakening of long deep rooted
        memories of whom and what we really are! Yoga, as union, implies perfect
        harmony of body and mind. It implies the harmonious integration of
        personality. The most common benefit of Yoga practice is the sense of
        well-being at all levels of our existence. Yoga has now got worldwide
        acceptance. On 11th December 2014, the 193 member UNGA approved India’s
        proposal by consensus with a record 177 co-sponsoring countries, a
        resolution to establish 21st June as “International Day of Yoga”. In its
        resolution, the UNGA recognized that Yoga provides a holistic approach
        to health and well-being and wider dissemination of information about
        the benefits of practicing Yoga for the health of the world population.
        Yoga also brings harmony in all walks of life and thus, is known for
        disease prevention, health promotion and management of many
        lifestyle-related disorders. Accordingly the first International Day of
        Yoga (IDY) was celebrated worldwide on 21st June 2015, subsequently in
        2016 and 2017 with full enthusiasm. Millions of people participated in
        commemorating IDY throughout the world. This shows the importance and
        growing demand for Yoga. The Certification in YOGA holders are getting
        ample job opportunities both in public and private sectors. Apart from
        the said course Institute has started Yoga educational, therapy and
        training programs. It is also conducting many activities for promotion,
        propagation and research of Yoga.
